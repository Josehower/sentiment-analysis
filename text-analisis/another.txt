One of the important skills that postgraduate students are expected to have is ADVANCED READING skills to read from expert texts. However at the postgraduate level in particular, reading from expert texts such as research articles requires understanding and application of specialist knowledge in order to interpret and make intertextual references. Postgraduate students whose first language is not English may have to become accustomed to the reading of academic texts in a second language, and the discoursal patterns that are specific to their disciplines. Despite difficulties which postgraduate students may experience, reading problems and the expected outcomes have been cited as one of the most neglected areas of research. In addition, little is known about second language students reading practices. This research explored the use of metacognitive questioning training in postgraduate classrooms with English as second language students on the four generally accepted elements of metacognition in reading: knowledge of task, knowledge of text, knowledge of self, and knowledge of strategies. The metacognitive questioning training was carried out for fourteen weeks and involved ten participants who were postgraduate students registered for the course at the university. Questionnaires were given out prior to and after the training to gauge their awareness of reading from expert texts like research articles. They were also asked to produce reflective notes during the training to explore their learning experience, and at the end of the course, they were interviewed for further insights. Findings of the study revealed six emerging themes in relation to the participants' awareness which are (1) learner self-awareness, (2) discourse community, (3) context of genre, (4) rhetorical structure features, (5) lexico-grammatical features and (6) citation conventions. 2
