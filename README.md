# Sentiment and emotion analyzer

This small app allow the user run an emotion and sentiment analysis to a text.

## Usage

To use this app you have two different options.

- The first one is just introduce your text as parameter to the run command, as you can see on the next example:

```sh
node index.js "I am good and nice and everything on my life is perfect"
```

NOTE: don't forget to use "" to wrap your text ("your text here")

- The second option is to create or save a file into the ./text-analisis folder and run the exact name and extension as parameter:

```sh
sh node index.js test.txt
```

NOTE: for best performance is recommended to use a .txt file extension.
